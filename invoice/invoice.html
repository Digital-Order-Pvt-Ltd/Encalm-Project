                        <li>How we protect your information:<br>
                            We want you to feel confident about using the Website to undertake the booking of Services,
                            so we are committed to protecting the information we collect. While no Website can guarantee
                            cent percent security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and
                            physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For
                            example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they
                            only may do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when
                            transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ
                            firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining
                            access to your information. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling,
                            technologies, and industry-standard firewalls. When you send personal information to the
                            Website over the Internet, your data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to
                            ensure safe transmission.</li>
                        <li>Data Retention:<br>
                            We will cease to retain your Personal Data when the purposes for which we collected your
                            Personal Data have ceased and/or when we are no longer required to continue retaining your
                            Personal Data for any legal or business purposes.</li>
                        <li>Changes to this Privacy Policy:<br>
